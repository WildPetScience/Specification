# Project Management

## Technical

### Source Control
Source code for the project will be maintained using Git, and hosted on
GitHub. We will attempt to follow [A successfull Git branching
model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to ensure that
our master branch is stable and working as much as possible. This will ensure
that when we come to demonstrate our software we always have a functional
version, even if it is missing some features.

Code will be peer-reviewed; this means that code should not be pushed directly
to the `master` or `develop` branches. To add code, commit to a new branch,
push the branch and submit a new pull request. All developers should "watch"
the repos on Github so that they are notified of other developers' pull
requests.

### IDE / Environment
We will use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Condor and Triton branches, and a
regular text editor to develop the Specification branch.

We will use the latest version of IntelliJ; if you are ever prompted for
updates, please do so. If this software update results in generated files
being changed then commit those changes to a separate branch.

We will use UNIX line endings for most files; this means that on Windows
computers, Notepad won't work as a text editor.

## Non-Technical
### Group Organisation
Nick Rogers has been appointed as project manager, and so is responsible for 
being our primary point of contact with the client. All communication
should go via Nick (including deliverables, organisational emails etc)
unless it is necessary to do otherwise.

### Meetings
Informal group meetings will be organised via Facebook and will normally occur
in the slots allocated for group projects by the computer lab. All members
shall attend all meetings if required, and all members must attend the formal
meetings with the client.
