# Project Management

## Technical

### Source Control
Source code for the project will be maintained using Git, and hosted on
GitHub. We will attempt to follow [A successfull Git branching
model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) to ensure that
our master branch is stable and working as much as possible. This will ensure
that when we come to demonstrate our software we always have a functional
version, even if it is missing some features.

### IDE / Environment
We will use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Condor and Triton branches, and a
regular text editor to develop the Specification branch.

We will use the latest version of IntelliJ; if you are ever prompted for
updates, please do so. If this software update results in generated files
being changed then commit those changes to a separate branch.

We will use UNIX line endings for most files; this means that on Windows
computers, Notepad won't work as a text editor.
