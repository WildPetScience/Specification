# Wild Pet Science - Project Plan

This document lays out the tasks to be primarily undertaken by each member of
the team, as well as the estimated time for these tasks to be completed. A
section of the implementation of the project has been allocated to each team
member such that all members will have the opportunity to demonstrate practical
programming skills, and that the overall division of work remains close to
equal.

## Overview
The specification document for the project includes a detailed breakdown of what
the requirements and functionality of the system should be when implemented
fully, as well as providing an overview of project management policy.

In contrast, here the project is broken down into implementation modules,
separated by the team member primarily responsible.
