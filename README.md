# Wild Pet Science - Specification

## Overview and Use Cases
The Wild Pet Science project allows users to compare their pets' behaviour to
other pets and animals in the wild. This is accomplished using a small computer
that tracks the position of a pet in its cage using a small digital camera and
image processing techniques, then analyses the data for information about 
routine and habits. The collected data can then be compared to the pets of other
users of the software and some wild animals (using publicly available data
from [Movebank](http://movebank.org)).

## System Components
The system will consist of the following components:

* *Server*: The server collects uploaded data about animals and displays results
  to users.

* *Client*: The client runs on a lightweight computer in the user's home and
  captures and analyses images from a live camera and uploads movement 
  data to the server.

These components will be developed independently and concurrently by the team.
