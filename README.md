# Wild Pet Science - Specification
## Overview and Use Cases
## System Components
### Client
In this specification, 'client' refers to a Raspberry Pi device that users run our software on. This section details the functionality that such a client should include in order for the project brief to be met.

#### Image Capture
The client should be able to capture images from a Raspberry Pi Noir camera. An appropriate API should be exposed (possibly through use of a third party library) to allow this.

#### Movement Tracking
Functionality should be included to track movement of objects between scenes captured by the camera.

#### Data Analysis
Some amount of data analysis should be carried out on the client (tracking center of movement, number of objects, activity classification).

#### Server Communication
The client should be able to upload analysed data to our server for visualisation and public / remote access.

#### Raspberry Pi "Plug & Play"
The Raspberry Pi client should be easy to set up for non-technical users (ideally plug and play).

#### Upload Processing
